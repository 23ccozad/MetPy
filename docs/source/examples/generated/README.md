This directory contains docs generated from the example notebooks. The
scripts can be regenerated automatically by running:

`ipython nbconvert`

This will pick up the configuration from the `ipython_nbconvert_config.py`
file in this directory. Don't add any stand-alone examples here, but rather
add notebooks in the appropriate directory.
