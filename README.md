MetPy is a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing and
performing calculations with weather data.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metpy/MetPy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metpy/MetPy)

MetPy is still in an early stage of development, and as such

just for fun, many things may still change as we work through
design issues.
